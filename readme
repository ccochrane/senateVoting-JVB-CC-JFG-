Abstract: Canada’s Senate has been undergoing a process of profound institutional transformation over the last several years. The expulsion of all Liberal senators from the party caucus and the creation of an Independent Advisory Board for Senate Appointments has led to a Senate that is now dominated by independents with no formal links to the Liberal government. A plurality of senators are now both independent and have been appointed under the IAB. What has been the impact of this change, and, in particular, to what degree has it achieved its stated goals of increasing the independence and ideological diversity of senators?
	
We address these questions by drawing on new sources of data about votes and speech in the House of Commons and the Senate. From the voting record, we use Social Network Analysis and DW-Nominate to situate the voting behavior of senators in relation to their counterparts in the House; from the digitized Hansard (www.lipad.ca), we use Wordfish, Wordscores, and leading distributed vector representations of words to situate parliamentarians in terms of their speech patterns.   In effect, we capture the degree to which parliamentarians vote and speak alike on the same issues.  We focus primarily on the the 41st and 42nd Parliaments (2011-2018). This period covers the expulsion of the Liberal senators from their caucus in early 2014, and thus will reveal what impact their expulsion had on their relative ideological position. This paper provide direct empirical analyses of an institutional reform of ongoing significance to Canadian politics.
